## Known Limitations

1. **AI Model Integration**: Currently uses mock AI for development. Cloud AI integration requires API keys.
2. **Production Keys**: Demo uses placeholder keys. Production deployment requires proper secret management.
3. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests at ~60% coverage. Can be expanded to 80%+ with additional test cases.
4. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Module structure defined but not fully implemented.
5. **Advanced AI Features**: Some advanced AI features (custom fine-tuning) require additional setup.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
1. Deploy demo to Azure using free credits
2. Configure production AI API keys
